  \section{Abstract}
  This social network project demonstrates a simple simulation of a few traditional but important epidemic models, such as SIR, SIS and SIRS models by using a Slashdot dataset as the underlying social network to be infected. The infectious behviour will be simulated for observation in order to understand the characteristic of the three epidemic models. Stanford Network Analysis Platform and Numpy is used for simulation of the epidemic models and social network. For epidemic models that require a long running time, Scikit-Learn is used to predict upon data simulated.
