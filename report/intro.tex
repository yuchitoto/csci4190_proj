  \section{Objective}
  Analysis on the 3 epidemic models, SIR, SIS, SIRS. And effect of network structure has upon the epidemic models.
  \section{Methodology}
  \subsection{Data Source}
  A Slashdot dataset is chosen to be the underlying social network of this epidemic simulation. Slashdot is a science and technology related social news website which is famous for its specific user community. In 2002, Slashdot allowed users to tag each other as friends or foes. The network used contains friends/foes links between the users of the Slashdot in Febuary\cite{leskovec2008community}.

  \subsection{Tool}
  Snap.py by the Stanford University was used to simulate the social network. Graph manipulation and social network simulation was done using Snap.py on Windows 10 and Windows Subsystem for Linux\cite{leskovec2016snap}.

  Numpy is used in the program for stating the state of each node in the social network and for after-processing the simulation data\cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}.

  Scikit-learn is used to do linear regression on simulation data of SIS model for prediction in order to replace long computation of equilibrium points of SIS model\cite{scikit-learn}.

  A list of other libraries used for analysis of data is provided below\cite{snapnets}.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Matplotlib \cite{Hunter:2007}
  \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Experiment Design}
  In this project, the three SIR, SIRS, SIS epidemic models are simulated using SNAP.py on Python 3. Every node in the network is assumed to be a person and every directed edge in the network is assumed to be a contact. Initially, all nodes in the network is assumed susceptible to the epidemic(S). A random number of \(s\) people in the network would be infectious(I) by the epidemic. And for each contact, the disease will have \(p\) probability to transmit to the uninfected nodes in each wave(\(t\)). For each infected person, they will be infectious for \(i\) waves. And if they have a temperary immune to the epidemic after infection, the immunity will exist for \(r\) days. The epidemic ends at wave \(t_end\) if there is no infectious(I) in network.

  A series of tests will be conducted by changing parameters \(p, r, i, s\) for observation on SIR, SIRS and SIS epidemic models. The observation will be based on average amount of infectious(I) and time(\(t\)) needed for the epidemic to end and no nodes in the network are infected.

  As the time(\(t\)) needed for epidemic to end in SIRS and SIS models is large, the amount of iterations of infection waves will be limited to 100 iterations and the termination time of the epidemics will be predicted using regression on peak infectious values and the number of infectious of each wave.

  The effect of network structure will also be investigated by randomly removing or adding a certain amount of edges to increase and decrease effective diameter of the network and the size of stronly connected components to investigate the effect of network structure in epidemics.

  \subsection{Strongly Connected Components}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{SccDist}

  Given the network is weakly connected, and there is no nodes of zero in and out degrees, all nodes are connected to each other with at least one in or out edge. The small 90\%, 95\% effective diameter and the 0.86782 fraction of nodes in the largest strongly connected component demonstrate a large amount of nodes are interconnected and there is a probability of \(0.86782^2\) that there exists a path from any node in the node in the network to another node in the network. And after removing self edges, there are 0.010835 fraction of nodes have no outgoing edges in the network, implies they are only included in some other nodes' circles, forms sinks in the network but not connect themselves to each other.
